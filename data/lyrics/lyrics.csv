Cotton-EyedJoe.ogg,english,folk,"Wait. vou Oh my dear, oh my dear, I love you so much. I love you so much. I've got a magic friend who's gone and it's not a bit better than a word. I'll say that a nigga won't steal when I found three in my car. One had a push, one had a bang, killed the hat and rose here round his neck. Raw high feet, let it come so full, look out over there, for I can't find you. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. I'll end the devil as the old folk's, nor would I like to grin and call for you. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. The long tailed bucks, the short-tailed dove, and I'll take your grin and call for you. Woo! Woo! Woo!"

Every Day Will Be Sunday When the Town Goes Dry - Edward Meeker (1919).ogg,english,spoken,"Mr. Pro-Offician says John Barley Corn must go. He must fly off with old Crow and the other friends we know. Old John has been champion for years beyond the doubt, but now it looks as if they count him out. Soon Clothes and Sense then will be out of date. Yes, when Pro-Offician comes they get the game. Goes by Hunter, so long Scott. Farewell, hey, Gann the Hague. Oh, my darling old frappé, they will soon take you away. As the travel note with Lola's they will serve us Coca-Cola. No more saying let me by. No more coming through the ride. Old man Hatman, Martini have received a big subpoena. Every day will be Sunday when the town goes dry. When the town goes dry a woman can't drive you to drink. If she does just stop and sing she will drive you to the sink. Which old men and women who have champagne on the frame will have us with the accent on the paint. When Pro-Offician knocks upon our door, yes, old Mr. Bromo Seltzer will be sawed. Goes by Hunter, so long Scott. Farewell, hey, Gann the Hague. Oh, my little glass of brew they are handling it to you. No more will you see the slackers flirting with the cheese and crackers. No more saying just one more. No more like half, no sight or ender hat you wear on Sunday won't be too small for you Monday. Every day will be Sunday when the town goes dry. Can you picture some big husky with a pickin' spade when it's nighty in the shade, pickin' warm-blooded lemonade? Many bourbon torters will enlist and join the ranks that every army will be full of tanks. Then rubber's and umbrellas won't be high. No, they won't be needed when the town is dry. Goes by Hunter, so long Scott. Farewell, hey, Gann the Hague. Oh, my little flocking fears you are goin' out of fears. Every little Broadway dotto will be sipping soda water. No more sayin' that, build a pale. No more feet up on the rails. You can vent that we will grimo when we have to gargle grimo. Every day will be Sunday when the town goes dry."

Everybody gives me good advice - Bob Roberts 1906.ogg,english,spoken,"Everybody gives me good advice. Sung by Barbrough, to listen to the records. Everybody gives me good advice. Everybody gives me good advice. Everybody gives me good advice. But then nobody offers me the price. Well, a glad handshake and a good kind word. Wouldn't buy a dinner for a hummingbird. Consolation may be very nice. But money cuts an awful lot of rice. See the very space and need that when you are in need. Everybody gives you good advice. Everybody gives you good advice. Everybody gives you good advice. Everybody gives you good advice. Everybody gives you good advice. Everybody gives you good advice. Everybody gives you good advice. If kind words were money, I'd have lots of dough. I'd get about a million from the friends I know. Cheer up now, fellow, everyone will say. Better times are coming, you'll have wealth some day. When you're feeling hungry, someone said to me, don't sit down and dream of taking pregnancy. Fresh air is as filling as a glass of wine. It's nice to sit down and dream of taking pregnancy. Everybody gives you good advice. Everybody gives you good advice. Everybody gives you good advice. But then nobody offers me the price. Well, a glad handshake and a good kind word. Wouldn't buy a dinner for a hummingbird. Consolation may be very nice. But money cuts an awful lot of rice. When you're feeling kind of blue and you ain't got a shoe, then the best you get is good and good. But money cuts an awful lot of rice."

It's all right to test our way, But then people start to pay, That no time for a business is done."
Boykisser song.wav,english,pop,"I like to sing boys, cause I'm a giddy boy kisser, I can't say guy anytime or day. In the meantime I'll be seeking joy, but I'll wait till the day I finally kiss a boy. I like to sing boys, cause I'm a giddy boy kisser, I can't say guy anytime or day. Feels like another dimension, it's something I can't explain. I look around but I'm left in dismay when I'm asking, where's all the men? I need a man with me, I want a boy, if it's not a boy then I don't wanna have any part of it. I'm facing it and out of this reality, when there's no one around to comfort me. Someday the law just forget me, searching it and not for an eternity. Wishing I'd find someone dreamy, is this a little too cheesy? I like to sing boys, cause I'm a giddy boy kisser, I can't say guy anytime or day. In the meantime I'll be seeking joy, but I'll wait till the day I finally kiss a boy."
Golden Vanity.ogg,english,folk,"Oh, there was a lofty ship and she set out to sea, and the name of the ship was Golden Vanity, and she sailed upon the low and lonesome low, and she sailed upon the lonesome sea. Well, she had not been out but two weeks or three when she was overtaken by Turkish Reveley, while she sailed upon the low and lonesome low, while she sailed upon the lonesome sea. Then upspeak our little cabin boy, saying, What will you give me if I will them destroy, if I sink them in the low and lonesome low, if I sink them in the lonesome sea? The man that them destroys our captain then replied, Five thousand pounds and my daughter for your bride, if you sink them in the low and lonesome low, if you sink them in the lonesome sea? The boy bent his breast and away swam here, he swam till he came to the Turkish Reveley, as she lay upon the low and lonesome low, as she lay upon the lonesome sea. He had a little tool which was made for the use, he bore nine holes in her hull all at once, and she sank upon the low and lonesome low, and she sank upon the lonesome sea. The boy bent his breast and back swam here, same captain take me up for a weed with the tide, and I'll drown upon the low and lonesome low, and I'll drown upon the lonesome sea. I will not take you up, our captain then replied, I'll shoot you, I'll drown you, I'll sink you in the tide, I will sink you in the low and lonesome low, I will sink you in the lonesome sea. If it were not for the love which I bear for your men, I do unto you as I did unto them, I would sink you in the low and lonesome low, I would sink you in the lonesome sea."

Harvest Hymn.ogg,english,folk,"Blessed with plentiful orchard and field, Richly laden with harvestine yield, People gather their love to bring, World of nature by praises to sing, Wound by rays at the sunlight at noon, Cooled at night, meet the stars and the moon, Seeds are nourished, take root and grow, World of nature thy wonders to show, Earth we witness the breath of thy land, Trackless ocean and bountiful sand, Loved in mountain and stream let's mow, World of nature with land for us all."

"Beautiful Ohio - Henry Burr & Ruth Lenox, 1919.ogg",english,spoken,"Long, long ago, someone I know had a little red canoe, in his room for only two. Love found it's dark, stained in my heart, and like a flower grew, drifting with the current down a moonlit stream, while above the heavens in their glory came, and the stars on high, twinkling in the sky, seeming in the paradise of love divine, dreaming of a pair of eyes that looked in my beautiful Ohio in dreams again I see, vision of what used to be. Drifting with the current down a moonlit stream, while above the heavens in their glory came, and the stars on high, twinkling in the sky, seeming in the paradise of love divine, dreaming of a pair of eyes that looked in my beautiful Ohio in dreams again I see, vision of what used to be.

"Dibdin - Oh, What A Charming Thing's A Battle.ogg",english,spoken,"Oh, what a charming thing's a battle! Trumpet-sounding drums are beating! Crack, crick, crack! The cannons rattle, the crick-ack the cannons rattle! Every heart with joy elating, every heart with joy elating! With what pleasure are we spying? From the front and from the rear, from the front and from the rear! Brown us in the smoky air, brown us in the smoky air! Heads and limbs and bullets flying, heads and limbs and bullets flying! Then the groans of soldiers dying, then the groans of soldiers dying! Just like sparrows as it were, just like sparrows as it were, and each pup hundreds drop, and each pup hundreds drop, pop, drop, pop, drop! While the muskets prattle, prattle, while the muskets prattle, prattle, till then wounded light unfounded for a charming thing's a battle! But the pleasant joke of all is when too close a tank we fall! Like mad bulls, each other butting! Shooting, stabbing, maiming, cutting! Horse and foot all go to it! Kills the word for men in cattle, little plunder, bloodthunder! What a charming thing's a battle!"
